        <p>
            For me, it is not important where I go, but who I go with,
            because being alone is very boring.
            I want to see the USA, South Korea, Malaysia, and Japan.

            I would see animals like pandas, tigers, lions, and others,
            even though I have already seen them before.

            And I would eat seafood.
